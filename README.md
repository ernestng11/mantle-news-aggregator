# Telegram News Funnel

A Python application that monitors Telegram channels and forwards messages to a bot with batching capabilities.

## How main.py Runs

### Application Flow

The application follows this execution flow when `main.py` is run:

#### 1. **Initialization Phase**
```python
# Setup logging and validate configuration
logger = setup_logger()
Config.validate_config()
```

#### 2. **Channel Monitor Creation**
```python
# Create the main monitoring service
monitor = ChannelMonitor()
await monitor.initialize()
```

#### 3. **Channel Addition**
```python
# Load channels from allowed_channels.txt and add them to monitoring
await monitor.add_channels(Config.TARGET_CHANNELS)
```

#### 4. **Monitoring Start**
```python
# Begin continuous monitoring with background tasks
await monitor.start_monitoring()
```

### Background Tasks

The application runs several background tasks simultaneously:

- **Message Processing**: Handles incoming messages from Telegram channels
- **Gap Filling**: Ensures no messages are missed during connection issues
- **Heartbeat**: Maintains connection health with periodic signals
- **Batch Processing**: Collects messages for 2 minutes before forwarding

### Message Flow

1. **Message Reception**: Telegram messages are received via event handlers
2. **URL Extraction**: URLs are extracted from message entities
3. **Batch Collection**: Messages are added to a 2-minute batch
4. **Batch Forwarding**: Collected messages are sent to configured bot targets

### Configuration

The application uses environment variables and configuration files:

- **`.env`**: Contains API credentials and bot settings
- **`allowed_channels.txt`**: List of Telegram channels to monitor
- **`config.py`**: Centralized configuration management

### Running the Application

```bash
# Install dependencies
poetry install

# Run the application
poetry run python -m src.main
```

### Expected Output

```
